While I understand the points presented by the article, I still feel like learning methods have some importance. I find myself wondering what their demographics for subjects were as I imagine for a neurotypical student, learning methods may have different effects. I have autism and that comes with a lot of weird little learning hurdles and preferences. I cannot focus on a lecture for too long while doing nothing so often I need to doodle or do a puzzle or something when attending lectures. I have tried to just sit still and listen but without that additional stimuli I struggle to focus or even enjoy learning. Maybe a method for learning isn't the most efficient, but maybe learning in a way that doesn't make someone miserable or tired or frustrated is worth the consideration? Despite my partial defense of "learning styles," I do think it is more complex than just three learning types. Learning is likely far more complex. If just one person like me needs to stim while listening to a history lecture but also need to repeatedly work through endless logic formulas in order to learn and enjoy learning to the best of my ability, I would not be surprised if any one person's needs can change from subject to subject, professor to professor, or even day to day.
