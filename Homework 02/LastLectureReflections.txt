When I sat down to watch the Last Lecture, and started taking notes, I had no idea the emotional reaction I was going to have at the end. The second head fake, albeit sweet and genius, had me crying. I had to step back from this lecture for a few days. I know why dedicating this lecture to his kids made me so emotional. My mother died in a similar yet very different way. She was dying all my life. It is hard to plan a lecture or advice for a child when you are unsure how long you have. For over a decade she held out until she didn't. To realize the lecture I had watched for over an hour was a love letter to the late doctor's own children was painfully cathartic. It was something I wish I had from my own mother. This reaction is niche, I admit, but it was intense enough to have me tear up while writing this.

I related a lot to Pausch's humor and passion. Maybe it's because I've struggled and tinkered with a lot so far but I agreed with his quote, "Experience is what you get when you don't get what you want." My life has been uprooted a few times despite how young I am and all I can learn from those experiences is how no fixed idea or goal is what you think it will be nor what you want it to be. Journey over destination type mindset but that doesn't mean you can't achieve nothing while you're traveling.
