GUI and CLI effectively serve similar purposes however, GUI is polished information and commands which can be intuitive to a greater userbase while CLI requires an understanding of code and the language of commands in order to use. This is also a great strength for CLI as the access to direct communication with a system, as opposed to interaction through predefined functions allow the user to do more and do a wider variety of things. That sounds vague but the general trade off, at least to me, is efficiency and accessibility at the cost of versatility versus greater utility and versatility at the cost of accessibility. Both user interfaces have uses, it just depends on the context of needs and of userbase in my opinion. I hope this short blurb of thoughts is enough. Feels too short given the papers I usually need to write but if it isn't I'll learn for next time.
