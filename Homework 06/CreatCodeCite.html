		<p>My name is Santiago. This is my first cite with html. I am sorry if things are a bit messy.</p>
		<p>I like food. Especially good places with good food. Here are a few:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://palmitosmexicaneatery.shop/">Los Palmitos (Classic and delicious spot if you're ever in SD)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://paulspancake.com/">Paul's Pancake Parlor (I like their food and vibe. Very cozy very safe.)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bridgepizza.com/menu-missoula/">Bridge Pizza (I personally love their London. Join the mushroom hivemind.)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://lolopeakbrewery.com/">Lolo Brewery (Tasty pub food and house made sodas. They have beer too I guess but hey, ginger ale!)</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>I like a few websites too. Prepare to enter the nerd zone. You've been warned:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/">Wikidot 5e (aka D&D Beyond but good and free)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube (aka my source of silly cat videos and based indie shows)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io (just a good place for small new indie games)</a></li>
		</ol>
